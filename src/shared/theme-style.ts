// controller (persistence + validation) and the renderer (DOM application),
// so the enum lives here rather than in src/lib.
//
//  - "painted": pixel-art borders and shell imagery (the original look).
//  - "flat":    the one clean-chrome theme — warm sepia near-black, edge-to-
//               edge flush panes with square corners, bundled JetBrains Mono +
//               Plus Jakarta Sans faces, and a solid accent border + soft drop
//               shadow on the focused pane.
//
// The style axis is orthogonal to the dark/light appearance (`data-theme`,
// see src/lib/use-theme.ts); both styles support both appearances.
//
// Legacy note: earlier builds split the flat look into "minimal" / "noir" /
// "ember". Those values are migrated to "flat" on every READ path
// (normalizeThemeStyle); the strict guard below rejects them on WRITE.
